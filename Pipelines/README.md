# CICD Pipelines

This folder contains all the different Azure DevOps pipelines in YAML format so they can be directly used in you DevOps project. 

These pipelines are written using the new Pipeline artifacts feature (see: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/pipeline-artifacts?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and they contain build and deploy stages in a single pipeline.
